Why does menu activation not work when I add makeBusy at the end of the method?

Game crashes if you open an inventory menu with more items than can be displayed.

Can't go top right or bottom right while holding interact???

Should the object of interaction apply the effects to the status of the actor?

ActorActionEngine is coupled too strongly to Actor? I.e., has access to too much stuff of actor class.

Broadcasters should not be given the colliding objects class, since it's kludgy to test for inherited classes. What's a better way to do this?

Figure out how to do collision handling better, since abilityObjects also need it.

Changed player avatar move commands to the new version, removed obselete command and methods. Removed walking_X and walking_Y effects. 

Refactor collisionHandler::

Current collisionHandler calls: 

isCollidedWithSolids by status of actor, which is used in attemptDisplacement and movePhysics (This should not be an event!)

interactiveObjectsNearRect by status of actor for outputting nearbyInteractives (can be treated as an event)

resolveBroadcasterCollisions by BroadcasterCommandProvider, which pushes commands to actors and makes the broadcasters do their onCollisionDo’s (can be treated as an event…)


New functionality:
Make two collisionHandlers, one for physical collisions, one for collisions associated with interactions
