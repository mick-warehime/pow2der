Why does menu activation not work when I add makeBusy at the end of the method?

Game crashes if you open an inventory menu with more items than can be displayed.

ActorActionEngine is coupled too strongly to Actor? I.e., has access to too much stuff of actor class.

Broadcasters should not be given the colliding objects class, since it's kludgy to test for inherited classes. What's a better way to do this?

Figure out how to do collision handling better, since abilityObjects also need it.

#########

Handle item’s being given the current level data.
contextual collisions are not handled appropriately either.

CollidesWithSolids interface now is Collider. It also has an assignContextualCollisions method, which is blank for non-actor colliders. ContextualCollisions is now a property of level. It’s now automatically assigned at level instantiation and when a new object is added to a sector. Like PhysicalCollisions, ContextualCollisions now uses SectorMap to check collisions, not the list owned by level.

possible error: a broadcaster with an interaction range extending past its own sector won’t be detected by shapes in the adjacent sectors.
