Why does menu activation not work when I add makeBusy at the end of the method?

Game crashes if you open an inventory menu with more items than can be displayed.

ActorActionEngine is coupled too strongly to Actor? I.e., has access to too much stuff of actor class.

Broadcasters should not be given the colliding objects class, since it's kludgy to test for inherited classes. What's a better way to do this?

Figure out how to do collision handling better, since abilityObjects also need it.

The way doors check if they can close now is buggy: if more than one collision occurs, one can allow the door to close even if the other doesn’t.

Holding run but letting go of a move button keeps you running.

Remove SpriteSheet from world (it shouldn’t be a global variable)
