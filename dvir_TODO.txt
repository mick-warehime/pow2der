Why does menu activation not work when I add makeBusy at the end of the method?

Game crashes if you open an inventory menu with more items than can be displayed.

ActorActionEngine is coupled too strongly to Actor? I.e., has access to too much stuff of actor class.

Broadcasters should not be given the colliding objects class, since it's kludgy to test for inherited classes. What's a better way to do this?

Figure out how to do collision handling better, since abilityObjects also need it.

Changed player avatar move commands to the new version, removed obselete command and methods. Removed walking_X and walking_Y effects.
